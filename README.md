## Introduction

My name is Diqi Zeng. I am a MAPSS student concentrating in psychology. I am interested in developmental psychology. Specially, I am interested in children's language development. I am currently working in Dr. Amanda Woodward's lab, studying how children's differs towards different language speakers. I am excited to attend this course and hope to gain more knowledge about R to help analyze my data in the near future!
