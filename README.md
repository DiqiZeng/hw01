## Introduction

My name is **Diqi Zeng**. I am a MAPSS student concentrating in psychology. I am interested in developmental psychology. Specifically, I am interested in children's language development. I am currently working in *Dr. Amanda Woodward's lab*, studying how children's differs towards different language speakers. I am very excited to attend this course and hope to gain more knowledge about R to help analyze my data in the near future!
